.. py:class:: ArcGISRESTful(base_url, layer = None, outformat = 'geojson', outfields = '*', crs = DEF_CRS, max_workers = 1, verbose = False, disable_retry = False)

   Access to an ArcGIS REST service.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   By default, all retrieval methods retry to get the missing feature IDs,
   if there are any. You can disable this behavior by setting ``disable_retry``
   to ``True``. If there are any missing feature IDs after the retry,
   they are saved to a text file, path of which can be accessed by
   ``self.client.failed_path``.

   :Parameters: * **base_url** (:class:`str`, *optional*) -- The ArcGIS RESTful service url. The URL must either include a layer number
                  after the last ``/`` in the url or the target layer must be passed as an argument.
                * **layer** (:class:`int`, *optional*) -- Target layer number, defaults to None. If None layer number must be included as after
                  the last ``/`` in ``base_url``.
                * **outformat** (:class:`str`, *optional*) -- One of the output formats offered by the selected layer. If not correct
                  a list of available formats is shown, defaults to ``geojson``.
                * **outfields** (:class:`str` or :class:`list`) -- The output fields to be requested. Setting ``*`` as outfields requests
                  all the available fields which is the default behaviour.
                * **crs** (:class:`str`, *optional*) -- The spatial reference of the output data, defaults to ``epsg:4326``.
                * **max_workers** (:class:`int`, *optional*) -- Number of simultaneous download, default to 1, i.e., no threading. Note
                  that some services might face issues when several requests are sent
                  simultaneously and will return the requests partially. It's recommended
                  to avoid using too many workers unless you are certain the web service
                  can handle it.
                * **verbose** (:class:`bool`, *optional*) -- If True, prints information about the requests and responses,
                  defaults to False.
                * **disable_retry** (:class:`bool`, *optional*) -- If ``True`` in case there are any failed queries, no retrying attempts
                  is done and object IDs of the failed requests is saved to a text file
                  which its path can be accessed via ``self.client.failed_path``.

                     defaults to ``False``.
                   * **return_geom** (:class:`bool`, *optional*) -- Whether to return the geometry of the feature, defaults to ``True``.

                     (tuple of length 4 (``(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)``)).
                   * **geo_crs** (:class:`str` or :class:`pyproj.CRS`) -- The spatial reference of the input geometry.
                   * **spatial_relation** (:class:`str`, *optional*) -- The spatial relationship to be applied on the input geometry

                  The data format to request for data from the service, defaults to None which

                  defaults to 1000. If the number of records requested is greater than this value,
